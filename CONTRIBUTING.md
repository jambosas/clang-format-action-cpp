# Contributing to Clang-Format Code Style Action for C++

I love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## I Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

## Any contributions you make will be under the Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [LICENSE](https://github.com/ydementieiev/clang-format-action-cpp/blob/master/LICENSE) that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ydementieiev/clang-format-action-cpp/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ydementieiev/clang-format-action-cpp/issues/new); it's that easy!
